				This photo was taken using the rule of thirds. I had climbed to a vantage to take is photo out over the field. This Photo was taken using a Nikon D60. The setting were ISO 100, f/5.3, 1/25s.
			</td>
			<td>
				To compensate for the darkness I increased the contrast to bring out the detail on the horizon. I also increased the whites and highlights to bring out the field. I used the sky replacement tool to make the picture more exciting. Finally I added a slightly warm tint to the picture to make the sky feel more accurate.

				This photo was taken using leading lines. I was standing at the entrance to a row of corn.  This Photo was taken using a Nikon D60. The setting were ISO 100, f/5.3, 1/125s.
			<td>
				This picture was shot a little under exposed so I started by increasing the exposure slightly. I changed the temperature to feel more warm/fall. I deepened the shadows to have convey more depth in the photo. I added a very slight green tint to make the plants more vibrant.

				This photo was taken using framing. I was 3 feet from the tractor looking in through the bars at the logo. This Photo was taken using a Nikon D60. The setting were ISO 400, f/5.6, 1/15s.
			<td>
				I started with a small crop to remove anything distracting on the edges and also exaggerate the framing. Next I increased the whites to help the logo pop. I then increased the contrast and deepened the shadows to richen the colors of the tractor.

				This photo was taken with the focus on Macy. I was about 15 feet from her. This Photo was taken using a Nikon D60. The setting were ISO 400, f/3.5, 1/10s.
			<td>
				The first step I took was cropping the image tighter to the subject, Macy. The original photo had really bright whites and really dark blacks. I then decreased the whites and the highlights. To help brighten Macy I decreased the blacks.
