		<tr>
			<td align="center">
				The goal of this project was to construct a visual display (infographic) that represents how the selected commmunication technology fits the communication model and enables an understanding of the technology'ss operating principle. the first major step of this project is to investigate a communication technology using a variety of resorces. While researching I was looking to descover origin, operating preinciples, uses, impacts, and possible future for the technology.

		<tr>
			<td align="center">
				Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a type of extrusion-based 3D printing technology that uses filament. Many different filaments can be used in FDM printing.

				<h3>Communication Model</h3>
			</td>
		</tr>



		<tr>
			<td align="center">
				FDM 3D printing, and 3D printing in general, is an excellent communication technology. Despite being an emerging technology, it has proven to be quite useful as an essential tool for quickly and efficiently communicating ideas. The capability of rapidly developing a 3D prototype is a valuable asset in the manufacturing process.

				<h3>Origin</h3>
			</td>
		</tr>



		<tr>
			<td align="center">
				3D printing was invented in Japan in the 1980s to develop a rapid prototyping system. The process involves breaking down a 3D model into layers.

				<h3>How it Works</h3>
			</td>
		</tr>



		<tr>
			<td align="center">
				In an FDM 3D printer, the filament is heated, extruded through a nozzle, and deposited on the print bed layer by layer to create a 3D object.
