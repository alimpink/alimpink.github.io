				These are my thumbnail sketches. I wanted to inspire young kids to think about and consider a career in steam. I stered by sketching simple bookmarks. I stubled upon the idea of using the word "STEAM" as the main focus of the book mark and surrounding it with "steam like" things.

				Once I had done some sketching and got my idea I moved to the comupter. I used Adobe's InDesign to create a rough layout. I stared by creating steam in the center. I then found some clipart that I liked and placed it around the word beign carful to leave some space around STEAM so it was ledgable. During my rough layout I was experimanting with different typefaces and pt. size. I setted on the Rockwell font at 85pt.

				Before I finalized my bookmark I changed one thing between my rough layout and my digital file. I added more white space aorund "STEAM". I found it much easier to read then before. With this digital file I was able to send it to the print station to prepare the image to be transfer the the press.
